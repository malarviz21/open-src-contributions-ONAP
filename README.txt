I contributed to 5G network automation on the ONAP platform, developing scalable backend services using Java, Spring Boot, Python, and microservices architecture. I led the Self-Organizing Networks (SON) use case, optimizing container orchestration with Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and real-time data streaming with Kafka, improving system scalability and efficiency. Additionally, I worked on "Smart Intent guarantee" by implementing an LSTM-based predictive model to monitor intent performance and ensure dynamic service orchestration in telecom operations, database optimization, frontend integration, and mentoring junior developers, collaborating with global teams to drive Agile development and present solutions in international forums.
